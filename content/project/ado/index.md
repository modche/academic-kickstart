# The Alpine Drought Observatory

According to the Alpine Convention, water scarcity and related conflicts are becoming a worrying topic in many Alpine regions, depending on water from snowmelt and glaciers. Moreover, lowland regions far beyond the Alps depend on alpine water resources. Thus, countries are invited to act on this topic with common strategies. 

Building on findings from previously funded projects (such as AlpWaterScarce), our aim is to set up an Alpine Drought Observatory (ADO) and to derive recommendations for improved risk preparedness and efficiency of drought management, specifically, for the Alpine territory. The **ADO** will be a transnational Alpine-wide operational system for monitoring droughts and their impacts. It will provide optimized observations (for mountainous areas), which could be integrated in existing EU-level monitoring systems (e.g. European Drought Observatory). 

The project is an INTERREG Alpine Space effort led by EURAC in Bozen (Italy).

The Faculty of Environment and Natural Resources at ALU-FR specializes in applied environmental research and has experience with all EU project formats. 

**Prof. Stahl's group focuses drought hazard and risk assessment, low flow and mountain hydrology**. Her research pioneered the approach of linking drought indicators to drought impacts to inform drought early warning. Stahl has a track-record on transdisciplinary research project leads including an international Belmont Forum project and the BW-regional research network DRIeR aiming at improved drought monitoring. Specifically, the European Drought Impact report Inventory developed under her direction as work package leader in the EU FP7 project DROUGHT-R&SPI will be put into practice in the planned ADO. Her research also focuses on alpine low flow hydrology and she coordinates a collaborative project on the future of the River Rhine. She was a partner in drought.ch, which will stand as model for ADO and keeps close links with EDO at JRC.
